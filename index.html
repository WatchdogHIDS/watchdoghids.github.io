                        In today's digital landscape, it has become necessary for even the smallest networks to consider
                        their security. Cyber attacks are becoming more common and easy to execute, which means that no
                        system can rely on being too small to be a target. Unfortunately, many users choose not to
                        address this issue, or perhaps not even realize it is an issue at all, leaving them vulnerable
                        and without any way to identify cyber incidents when they inevitably occur. Attacks can leave
                        networks unable to function properly and can even expose sensitive data. Current intrusion
                        detection solutions are costly and complicated to set up, making them infeasible for most users.
                        Watchdog aims to give these users an affordable and lightweight option for detecting unusual
                        behavior on their machines (referred to as endpoints), enabling them to more effectively respond
                        to cyber incidents.

                        Watchdog aims to provide a low-resource and cost-effective solution to this problem by
                        implementing a Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS). This system will continuously monitor
                        devices for signs of intrusion, such as unusual behavior or unauthorized access attempts in
                        secure file locations within home networks, small businesses, media servers, or self-hosted
                        applications.

                    <p class="indented">
                        Detection methods will include heuristic analysis, identifying potential threats based on
                        patterns such as unusually high CPU usage, spikes in outgoing network traffic, or other
                        anomalous system behaviors that could indicate a security breach. This approach will require
                        little configuration on the part of the end-user unless so desired. Since it will focus on the
                        models and engine we create, it will serve as a sufficient launch point for most, if not all
                        users. There will be the option to configure specifics of the program, such as exceptions to the
                        heuristic checks, for the more advanced users who want to tinker with the specificity of the
                        system and allow them to only be alerted of situations they deem dangerous. All of this data
                        will be streamed in real-time to an internal, self-hosted central server, which will analyze it
                        and create detailed reports about endpoint activity. Here, administrators can review incidents,
                        manage incidents, and manually prioritize threats based on severity.

                        By creating a robust yet lightweight security layer, Watchdog empowers users to safeguard their
                        digital assets without the need for extensive security expertise or significant financial
                        investments. This project idea serves as an ideal capstone as it addresses a real-world problem,
                        demonstrates technical proficiency in security systems, and showcases the ability to design and
                        implement a solution tailored to specific user needs. Watchdog has the potential to make a
                        tangible impact on the cybersecurity landscape for users who would not have normally made
                        cybersecurity a priority, making it a compelling and worthwhile capstone project.
