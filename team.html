                    <h3>Turin Briggs</h3>
                    <p>Turin is a backend-focused software developer graduating with a B.Sc. in Computer Science with
                        the Computer Systems track certificate from the University of Utah. With four years of
                        experience in backend API and database development, he has contributed to the design,
                        maintenance, and integration of secure, reliable systems across a variety of production
                        environments. For the Watchdog HIDS project, he was responsible for the Database and Node server
                        while also integrating the various components of the watchdog service suite. He also handled the
                        Dockerization of Watchdog to provide a simple setup process.</p>
                    <p>Turin's professional interests lie at the intersection of cybersecurity, operational procedures,
                        policy, and compliance. He is particularly drawn to the challenges of assessing systems
                        and devising plans to ensure they align with organizational goals and regulatory frameworks.</p>
                    <p>Outside of work, Turin manages a sophisticated home server setup running a range of self-hosted
                        services including media servers, NAS, and creative workload offloading. He also enjoys playing
                        euro board games, 3D printing, and reading philosophy textsâ€”interests that allow him to explore
                        creative ideas and engage in the optimization of complex systems.</p>
